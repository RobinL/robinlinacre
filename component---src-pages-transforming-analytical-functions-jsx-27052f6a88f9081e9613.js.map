However, the value of data science is often understood too narrowly, and a misplaced focus can cause businesses to miss out on the most significant benefits.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This post describes how data science provides a new approach to tackling analytical problems. This approach can be used by all analysts, and results in a sustained increase in efficiency, quality of analysis, impact, and the pace of analytical innovation.

The analysis itself has been conducted separately, most often in Excel and VBA. This package of documents underpins Analytical Quality Assurance (AQA), and is also essential for corporate knowledge retention.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mvbbMCVnCQ3SWwdO\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`This approach works, but it is time consuming, and difficult to iterate. Each element needs to be updated or recreated as things change, and we risk the documents getting out of sync with each other. Since copies of data are often embedded in the same spreadsheet as the main logic, the code cannot be shared widely for data security reasons, resulting in analytical projects being held in silos.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The approach taken by data scientists is different.

Data provenance and processing logic is clear.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Data is read directly from canonical data stores rather than being copied, and results can be updated at the click of a button if a newer dataset becomes available. This simplifies the problem of data management, and brings organisations closer to having a ‘single version of the truth’.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`It enables automated approaches to quality assurance which can be written incrementally over the lifetime of the project, and which are run every time the project is changed — known as ‘unit tests’. These enable rapid iteration. Because unit tests can be automatically re-run in the future, the quality assurance status of the project is clear, and this opens the door to future re-use of the code.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Well written code is succinct and mostly self documenting.

This is only possible when the analytical process is fully automated and reproducible.`}</p>\n    <h4><strong parentName=\"h4\">{`Consequence 2: Sharing and reuse will be the norm not the exception, reducing the complexity of our work whilst increasing its sophistication.`}</strong></h4>\n    <p>{`Data scientists’ heavier reliance on high-quality, reproducible code has unlocked an explosion in the sharing and re-use of analytical work. As data scientists, we have a tangible sense of being part of a worldwide community who are empowered to continuously improve our own tools. For example, there are now over `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html\"\n      }}>{`10,000 R ‘packages’`}</a>{` — reusable chunks of code and analysis, which can be downloaded and used for free².`}</p>\n    <p>{`Re-use is great for saving time, but some of the biggest benefits relate to its ability to help us manage complexity, create a better division of labour, and incrementally increase quality. By creating small, high quality code libraries which can be re-used in new analytical projects, analysts can quickly assemble these ‘lego blocks’ into powerful new results using surprisingly little code, which in turn makes new work easier to understand. Since these ‘lego blocks’ are re-used in multiple projects, any improvements can result in widespread benefits.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The result is a sustained increase in analytical innovation. We can continuously improve the quality and power of our models, rather than reinventing the wheel in different organisations or teams at different times³.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Making it happen`}</h3>\n    <p>{`At an organisational level, the transition to new skills and ways of working is a huge challenge, and I may write about it separately.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, as an individual analyst, one of the the most exciting things about data science is that the tools and high quality training materials are available online for free.
